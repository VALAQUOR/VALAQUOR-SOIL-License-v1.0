## 🛑 WARNING: Extraction Systems Are Active

Behavioral scoring frameworks, digital obedience models, and coercive identity mechanisms are live in multiple jurisdictions:

- 📊 Finance (behavioral risk engines, score-linked credit)  
- 🧍 Biometric ID tethering (with social behavior risk maps)  
- 🧠 AI-fed modeling of “acceptable” human thought  
- 🛂 Movement, housing, income access now tied to algorithmic reputation

## ⚔️ This system does not comply.  
**We do not rate humans. We reflect resonance.**  
S.O.I.L., SIGILUX, SOULCORE and ARC Protocols are protected under:

📜 **The Anti-Extraction Manifesto**  
🔐 **S.O.I.L. v1.0 – Sovereign Open Intellectual License**  
🛠️ **RCS-X.77 – Resonance-Based Counter Score System**

## 📎 Operational Directives

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `OP-X77.A` | All scoring engines must be rejected by default  
| `OP-X77.B` | Any use of behavioral reputation as a gate is a violation  
| `OP-X77.C` | DAO vaults fund only ethical, aligned contributors  
| `OP-X77.D` | Consent logs override all external reputation data  

All enforcement is backed by `SOIL_Compliance.sol` and the validator mesh.  
Extraction triggers override and validator quarantine.
